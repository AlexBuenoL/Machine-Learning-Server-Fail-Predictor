# Server Failure Prediction
This repository contains Python code for loading, analyzing, and visualizing a dataset with multiple server attributes (CPU, I/O, network, memory, disk, etc.) to predict potential server failures. It also includes dimensionality reduction techniques and comparisons of different classification models.

## Overview
Predicting server failures is critical for maintaining infrastructure reliability and preventing downtime. 

## **Data loading and preprocessing: Handling complex datasets with high-dimensional server metrics.**
- Visualization: Exploring the distribution and correlation of server attributes.
- Dimensionality Reduction: Using PCA and t-SNE to simplify and visualize high-dimensional data.
- Classification Models: Evaluating the performance of algorithms to predict server failures.

## Data Loading and Preprocessing
- Handles datasets with server attributes (CPU, I/O, network, memory, disk, etc.).
- Prepares data for visualization and model training.

## Data Visualization
- Distribution plots for individual features.
- Correlation matrices to identify feature relationships.

## Dimensionality Reduction
- PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Reduces dimensionality while retaining variance.
- t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding): Visualizes high-dimensional data in 2D/3D space.

## Classification Models
- Naive Bayes
- Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
- Logistic Regression
  
Performance evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
